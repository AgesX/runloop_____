At the application level, all threads behave in essentially the same way as on other platforms. 

After starting a thread, the thread runs in one of three main states: 


# running, ready, or blocked. 



If a thread is not currently running, it is either blocked and waiting for input or it is ready to run but not scheduled to do so yet. The thread continues moving back and forth among these states until it finally exits and moves to the terminated state.
